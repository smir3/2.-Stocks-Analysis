# Stocks-Analysis

Overview of Project

  Background
  As fossil fuels get depleted Steve's parents believe green energy will become more 
  popular and the main source of energy. They want to invest all their money into DAQO    
  New Energy Corp. He has been asked by his parents to investigate the green energy 
  stock market.  Steve is concerned about diversifying their stocks, and so he is 
  interested in analyzing a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stocks.
  
  Purpose 
  Steve has created an excel file containing a list of green energy company stock data 
  and has tasked me with analyzing the performance of these stocks. The purpose is to 
  generate a list of recommended stocks for his parents to invest in. 

Results
   
   DAQO Analysis  
   In 2017, the return for the DAQO stock was 199.4%. Therefore, the value of the stock 
   grew considerably during the year. However, in 2018, the value of the stock decreased 
   over the year since the return was -0.62602. 
   
   Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018
   In 2017, all the green energy stocks - other than TERP - had a positive return. All 
   of these stocks had a positive return above 5%, with the top four returns of 101.3%, 
   129.5%, 184.5%, and 199.4% belonging to the stocks FSLR, ENPH, SEDG, and DAQO.
   
   In contrast, all the green energy stocks had a negative return in 2018, other than 
   ENPH and RUN which had returns of 81.9% and 84.0%. 
   
   Execution times of the original script and the refractored script
   The execution time for the refractored script was 0.1484375 for the 2017 data, and 
   0.109375 for the 2018 data. The execution script for the non-refractored script took 
   longer, with times of 1.0625 for the 2017 data, and 1.054688 for the 2018 data.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?

Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

Conclusion
   I would not recommend that Steve's parents invest in any of the stocks with positive returns in 2017 which also have negative returns in 2018. This is because the 
   stock has demonstrated worse performance in the most recent year. Specifically, Steve's parents are not recommended to invest in DAQO. 
   
   The only stock which had positive returns in 2017 and 2018 was ENPHtherefore Steve's parents can look into investing into this company. They could also look into conducting further research into this company to project future performance 
   before investings (example looking into news reportings, journals etc.)
