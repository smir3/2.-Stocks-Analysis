# Green Energy Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project

  ## Background
  As fossil fuels get depleted Steve's parents believe green energy will become more 
  popular and the main source of energy. They want to invest all their money into DAQO    
  New Energy Corp. He has been asked by his parents to investigate the green energy 
  stock market.  Steve is concerned about diversifying their stocks, and so he is 
  interested in analyzing a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stocks.
  
  ## Purpose 
  Steve has created an excel file containing a list of green energy company stock data 
  and has tasked me with analyzing the performance of these stocks. The purpose is to 
  generate a list of recommended stocks for his parents to invest in. 

## Results
   
   ## DAQO Analysis  
   In 2017, the return for the DAQO stock was 199.4%. Therefore, the value of the stock 
   grew considerably during the year. However, in 2018, the value of the stock decreased 
   over the year since the return was -0.62602. 
   
   ## Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018
   In 2017, all the green energy stocks - other than TERP - had a positive return. The top four returns were 101.3%, 
   129.5%, 184.5%, and 199.4% which belonged to the stocks FSLR, ENPH, SEDG, and DAQO.
   
   In contrast, all the green energy stocks had a negative return in 2018, other than 
   ENPH and RUN, which had returns of 81.9% and 84.0%. 
   
   Execution times of the original script and the refractored script
   The execution time for the refractored script was 0.1484375 for the 2017 data, and 
   0.109375 for the 2018 data. The execution script for the non-refractored script took 
   considerably longer, with times of 1.0625 for the 2017 data, and 1.054688 for the 2018 data.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?

   ## Disadvantages
   In order to refractor the code well, you must properly understand the logic of the original script. The disadvantages of refractoring the code is the additional time-taken to 
   revisit the script, understand it, analyze it, and edit it. This is especially difficult when you are refactoring someone else's code as there is the additional struggle of 
   understanding someone else's logic. It would be helpful if they included logic labels for each individual code.
 
   ## Advantages
   First attempts at a code will not always be the best way to accomplish a task, therefore refactoring is a common part of the job. Refactoring a code works to make a code more 
   efficient by reducing the number of steps, using less memory, improving the logic of the code, and making it easier for future users to understand and read.  

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

  When refactoring the VBA script for this challenge, I did experience the con of trying to re-understand the original script in order to edit it effectively. This process did 
  take a considerable amount of time. However, refactoring the code was useful as it reduced the execution time considerably. Refactoring the code also improved logical flow by 
  removing unnecessary code and making the script more concise. Reducing the execution time and improving efficiency is important since it will make it easier for future users 
  to understand, and this code is intended to be used by others.

## Conclusion
   I would not recommend that Steve's parents invest in any of the stocks with positive returns in 2017 as well as negative returns in 2018. This is because the 
   stock has demonstrated worse performance in the most recent year. Specifically, Steve's parents are not recommended to invest in DAQO New Energy Corp. 
   
   The only stock which had positive returns in 2017 and 2018 was ENPH. Therefore, I would recommend that Steve's parents look into investing into this company. They could also 
   look into conducting further research to project the future performance of this company before investings (ex. look into news reportings, journals etc.).
